'''
This utility sets up the python configuration files so as to
allow Python to find files in a specified directory, regardless
of what directory the user is working from.  This is typically
used to create a directory where the user will put resources shared
by many Python scripts, such as courseware modules

Usage
-----
* Put a copy of this file (setpath.py) in the directory you want to share

* Execute setpath.py, either by opening it and running it
  in Canopy, or from the command line by changing director
  to the directory you want to share and then typing

  >>> python setup.py

  If you run it by opening it in the Canopy editor you need to
  select the directory popup menu item that tells Canopy to
  change the working directory to the Editor directory.
  in Canopy, the working directory always appears at the upper
  right corner of the Python interpreter window. 
 
Notes
-----
 
This will create a startup file which will properly 
initialize ipython (whether used directly or via Enthought
Canopy) to find your files, and will do that regardless
of your operating system.

If you are using a Linux or Mac OSX operating system, it
will also edit your .cshrc and .bash_profile shell startup
scripts to set the environment variable PYTHONPATH so that
any version of the python interperter started from the 
command line (i.e. whether ipython or python) will find
the shared files.  This feature will not work on
Windows operating systems, so Windows users should start
either start up python by clicking on the Canopy app, or
by starting ipython from the command line. It is possible
to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable in Windows,
but this script does not yet implement that feature. 

Note that it is also possible to manually set up a temporary
shared path (for example /home/MyModules) in a given script 
by executing the lines:

    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.path.append('home/MyModules')

where you would replace '/home/MyModules') with the
actual full path to the directory you want on your own
system
