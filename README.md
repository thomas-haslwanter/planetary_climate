## planetary_climate
This repository contains Python utilities for the book
"Principles of Planetary Climate", by Raymond T. Pierrehumbert

### utilities
    gases.py ...... physical properties of some gases important for planetary atmospheres
                    includes the corresponding *DataFrame* structures
    math_demos.py . demonstrates important mathematical tools for climate-calculations
    math_demos.ipynb ... corresponding IPython-notebook
    phys.py ....... some physical constants
    planets.py .... physical properties of planets, and some moons
                    includes the corresponding *DataFrame* structures
    satvp.py ...... functions for the determination of *saturation vapor pressure*,
                    and for the calculation of the *moist adiabate*
    setpath.py .... adds the current folder to the IPython-path

### utilities\oldClimateUtilities
    Folder containing the original *ClimateUtilities* for Python 3.
    These have now been replace with *pandas* and *scipy* functions,
    and the new versions can be found in the folder *utilities.


### chapter_1
